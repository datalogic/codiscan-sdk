# CODiScan SDK

The CODiScan SDK empowers users to write Android applications that interface with a connected CODiScanâ„¢ HS7600 wearable Bluetooth bar code reader.

A prerequisite of the CODiScan SDK is the installation of the CODiScan Service. The CODiScan SDK binds to this service to be able to pair and interact with a CODiScan device.
